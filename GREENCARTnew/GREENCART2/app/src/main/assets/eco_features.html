    <h2>Eco Brand Directory</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A curated, trustworthy directory of eco-friendly brands and local markets. Filter by category (fashion, food, beauty), certifications (Organic, Vegan, Fair Trade), eco-score, and distance to turn intention into informed action.</p>
    <h3>Key Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cuts through greenwashing with certifications, materials info, and brand eco-scores.</li>
      <li>Saves time by putting verified brands and stores in one place.</li>
      <li>Encourages lower-footprint choices by surfacing local and ethical options.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>User Interaction</h3>
    <p>Open Directory → Apply filters (e.g., “Fair Trade, nearby, 4★+ eco-score”) → Tap a brand → View highlights, certifications, and “Visit Store” or “View Products.” Bookmark and follow categories for alerts.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Searching “organic cotton shirts” shows GreenEarth Clothing (eco-score 4.7/5, Organic + Fair Trade). Local pickup reduces shipping emissions and supports ethical labor.</p>

    <h2>Eco Scanner (Smart Product Scan)</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Scan any barcode/QR to see an instant eco-profile: eco rating (0–100%), materials, packaging type, recyclability, and verified labels. Get greener alternatives plus a quick “Why this matters.”</p>
    <h3>Key Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time transparency at the shelf — no guesswork.</li>
      <li>Highlights packaging impacts to reduce plastic waste (packaging is a major driver of plastic use globally).</li>
      <li>Helps avoid impulse buys that don’t meet your values.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>User Interaction</h3>
    <p>Tap Scan → Point camera at barcode → View eco rating, packaging info, certifications, and “Better Alternatives.” Add to Wishlist or Share to Community; save to Dashboard to track impact.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Scanning a shampoo (rating 62%) flags non-recycled PET packaging and suggests a bar shampoo in paper packaging — switching can avoid ~12 plastic bottles/year.</p>
